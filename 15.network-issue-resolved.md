# Kubernetes Network Issue Resolution

## Issue:
Pods in AKS cannot communicate with external services due to incorrect network policies.

## Resolution:
- Verified Network Policies and discovered the missing `egress` rule.
- Updated the `network-policy.yaml` to allow egress traffic.

## Steps Taken:
1. Edited the network policy to include outbound traffic rules.
2. Redeployed the application.
3. Verified connectivity using `kubectl exec`.
