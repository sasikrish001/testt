# Branching Strategy

## Main Branches
- **main**: Stable production-ready code.
- **develop**: Ongoing development, always ready for testing.

## Feature Branches
- Named as `feature/{feature-name}`, e.g., `feature/login-page`.
- Branch off from `develop`.

## Release Branches
- Named as `release/{version}`, e.g., `release/1.0.0`.
- Used for preparing production releases.

## Hotfix Branches
- Named as `hotfix/{bug-fix}`, e.g., `hotfix/fix-auth-bug`.
- Branch off from `main` for urgent fixes.
