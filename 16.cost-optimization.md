# Cost Optimization Recommendations

## Observations:
- AKS Cluster size is over-provisioned.
- Under-utilized Azure resources (e.g., unused virtual machines).

## Recommendations:
1. Resize AKS nodes to smaller instances (e.g., Standard_DS1_v2).
2. Use Azure Advisor to identify idle resources and scale down.
3. Implement auto-scaling for AKS based on workload demand.
